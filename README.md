### Machine-Learning-Specialization

This Specialization from leading researchers at the University of Washington introduces you to the exciting, high-demand field of Machine Learning. Through a series of practical case studies, you will gain applied experience in major areas of Machine Learning including Prediction, Classification, Clustering, and Information Retrieval. You will learn to analyze large and complex datasets, create systems that adapt and improve over time, and build intelligent applications that can make predictions from data.

Applied Learning Project
Learners will implement and apply predictive, classification, clustering, and information retrieval machine learning algorithms to real datasets throughout each course in the specialization. They will walk away with applied machine learning and Python programming experience.
